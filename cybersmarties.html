          Since August 2024, I have been working with CyberSmarties Ltd., an
          educational platform dedicated to online safety, education, and
          wellbeing for children. In my role, I have been leading a comprehensive
          redesign aimed at enhancing user-friendliness, visual appeal, and
          engagement, ensuring an accessible, enjoyable experience for young
          users. Due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), I am currently awaiting
          approval on specific project details I may include in my portfolio.

              <p class="spaced-paragraph">
                I was responsible for the complete UX workflow for Cybersmarties, a secure social learning platform promoting online safety, responsible digital behaviour, and emotional wellbeing for children. The project aimed to improve the look and feel, usability, and engagement through age-appropriate interfaces for children aged 6 to 12.

              <h3>The Challenge</h3>

              <p class="spaced-paragraph">
                The platform required a redesign to address usability challenges, modernise its visuals, and enhance engagement. A key focus was reimagining the emotional check-in system (Claire Bot) to make it more engaging and intrinsically motivating for children. This feature supported self-reflection and emotional learning for children while collecting wellbeing data for teachers, making consistent engagement critical.

        <div class="spaced-content">
          <h3>Analysis</h3>
          <p class="spaced-paragraph">After initial stakeholder discussions, I conducted a UX audit to identify pain points and opportunities, including:</p>
          <ul class="approach-list spaced-paragraph">
            <li>Mapping the current platform, user flows, and analysing information architecture.</li>
            <li>Creating customer journey maps and personas to uncover friction points and user needs.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p class="spaced-paragraph">I proposed solutions through consultations, wireframes, and prototypes respectively, and applied iterative refinements based on feedback. I also redesigned the UI, including icons, colour palettes, typography, and layouts to create visually engaging, age-appropriate interfaces.</p>
          <p class="spaced-paragraph">For the emotional check-in system, I introduced a digital pet concept that encouraged children to check in voluntarily. Rewards like stickers and profile customisation fostered intrinsic motivation, and made the system more engaging.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>

        <div class="spaced-content">
          <h3>Impact</h3>
          <p class="spaced-paragraph">The redesign received positive stakeholder feedback and provided a strong foundation for future development. The digital pet concept offered a more engaging alternative to the existing wellbeing check-in system while supporting the platformâ€™s mission.</p>
          
          <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
          
          <p class="spaced-paragraph">This project strengthened my ability to lead UX processes, from stakeholder engagement to delivering actionable designs. It deepened my skills in designing for younger audiences, creating engaging wellbeing tools, and motivating users through rewarding experiences.
