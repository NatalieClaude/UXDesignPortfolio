          Stay.com is a desktop app developed during my UX Design Professional
          Diploma, aimed at addressing common user experience issues found in
          hotel booking platforms. This project builds on successful design
          patterns while resolving usability challenges, creating a streamlined,
          user-friendly booking process.

        <h3 class="mt-small">The Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Many hotel booking websites suffer from poor usability, frustrating
          users with confusing navigation, unclear information, and inefficient
          booking processes. The goal was to create a website that prioritises
          intuitive design, clarity, and efficiency, delivering a smoother and
          more pleasant booking experience.
        </p>
     
        <h3 class="mt-small">The Process</h3>
        <p>
          To identify key issues, I conducted user research through competitive
          benchmarking, surveys, and user testing. These findings were
          synthesised into six primary usability problems using affinity
          mapping, customer journey mapping, and user flow diagrams.
          Low-fidelity sketches were developed, followed by a high-fidelity
          interactive prototype in Figma, which was tested for effectiveness and
          refined based on user feedback.

        <h3 class="mt-small">Research Method and Tools</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure credible findings, I applied a triangulation method, 
          incorporating competitive benchmarking, user surveys, interviews, and usability testing. 
          This cross-referenced data helped identify patterns and solidify insights, 
          ensuring that the design decisions were based on comprehensive research.

        <h2 class="mt-medium">Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Using tools such as affinity mapping and customer journey maps, 
          I synthesised the unstructured research data into six key insights that
          directly influenced design decisions.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-small">Analysis Findings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Interface Design:</span> Busy interfaces
            with poor readability (small fonts and low contrast) frustrated
            users and increased cognitive load.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Flow Design:</span> Users frequently
            experienced disjointed flows, leading to restarts and premature
            decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Search Functionality:</span> Buggy calendars
            and difficulties finding hotel locations made search tasks
            cumbersome.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Option Comparison:</span> Excessive
            scrolling and information overload prevented users from effectively
            comparing hotels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Adding Extras:</span> Unclear descriptions,
            confusing pricing, and inconsistent options created friction when
            adding extras.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Booking Completion</span>: The lack of
            transparency in the final booking steps created uncertainty for
            users.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-small">Design Implications</h3>
        <p>These findings had a significant impact on the design:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The interface needed to be simplified, with improved readability and reduced clutter.</li>
          <li>The flow had to be redesigned to offer more flexibility and guide users through a seamless booking process.</li>
          <li>The search experience required a more intuitive and reliable calendar and map interface.</li>
          <li>Option comparison needed to be streamlined with better filters and layouts to reduce scrolling.</li>
          <li>Extras had to be presented clearly, with dynamic feedback to avoid confusion.</li>
          <li>Booking completion required enhanced transparency and a clear summary for final confirmation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Finally, I used Figma to build a high-fidelity interactive prototype for evaluative testing.
        </p>

        <!-- Sketches Subsection: Sketch examples used in the design process -->
        <h3 class="mt-small">Sketches</h3>
        <p>
          I started with sketches to quickly map out design ideas based on the issues found in the analysis. 
          These sketches helped visualise the booking flow, user
          interface, and layout while allowing me to identify and address
          potential issues early in the process.

          <li><span class="bold-text">Arrow pointing to calendar sketch</span>: "Early design for the booking calendar to improve usability."</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- User Flow Diagram Subsection -->
        <h3 class="mt-small">User Flow Diagram</h3>
        <p>Next, I created a user-flow diagram to refine the user's path.  
          This also helped identify problems early on and iterate quickly.</p>

        <!-- Prototyping Section -->
        <h2 class="mt-medium">Prototyping</h2>
        <p>
          After finalising the design with sketches and user flow diagrams, 
          I developed a high-fidelity interactive prototype in Figma for evaluative testing.

        <!-- Streamlined Interface Design Section -->
        <h4 class="mt-small">Streamlined Interface Design</h4>
        <p>
          The interface was simplified to focus on key booking elements, reducing cognitive load.

          <h2 class="mt-medium">Evaluative Testing</h2>
          <p>
            I conducted user tests to evaluate the design's effectiveness by
            having users book a hotel room through the prototype. Key findings
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Interface Design:</span> Generally well-received, though text size was occasionally noted as too small.</li>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Flow:</span> Smooth overall, though breadcrumb navigation had minimal impact.</li>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Search:</span> Calendar interaction was smooth, but map functionality needed refinement.</li>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Option Comparison:</span> Users found it easy to compare options but wanted more overview information.</li>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Adding Extras:</span> Clear navigation, though some users found checkboxes confusing.</li>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Booking Completion:</span> Users were satisfied with the summary but noted that text size could be larger.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="mt-medium">Further Development</h2>
          <p>Based on user feedback, I identified key areas for future improvement:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Increase text size in key areas for better readability.</li>
            <li>Provide more overview information to reduce uncertainty during option comparison.</li>
            <li>Ensure breadcrumb navigation is consistently used throughout all stages of the booking process.</li>
            <li>Refine map functionality for smoother interaction.</li>
            <li>Clarify the purpose of checkboxes in the extras window to reduce confusion.</li>
