          Stay.com is a desktop app developed during my UX Design Professional
          Diploma, aimed at addressing common user experience issues found in
          hotel booking platforms. This project builds on successful design
          patterns while resolving usability challenges, creating a streamlined,
          user-friendly booking process.

                  <h3>The Problem</h3>
                  <p>
                      Many hotel booking websites suffer from poor usability, frustrating
                      users with confusing navigation, unclear information, and inefficient
                      booking processes. The goal was to create a website that prioritises
                      intuitive design, clarity, and efficiency, delivering a smoother and
                      more pleasant booking experience.

              <h3>The Process</h3>
              <p>
                  To identify key issues, I conducted user research through competitive
                  benchmarking, surveys, and user testing. These findings were
                  synthesized into six primary usability problems using affinity
                  mapping, customer journey mapping, and user flow diagrams.
                  Low-fidelity sketches were developed, followed by a high-fidelity
                  interactive prototype in Figma, which was tested for effectiveness and
                  refined based on user feedback.

                <p>
                    To ensure credible findings, I applied a triangulation method,
                    incorporating competitive benchmarking, user surveys, interviews, and usability testing. 
                    This cross-referenced data helped identify patterns and solidify insights, 
                    ensuring that the design decisions were based on comprehensive research.

          Using tools such as affinity mapping and customer journey maps,

        <h3 class="mt-small">Analysis Findings</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Interface Design:</span> Busy interfaces
            with poor readability (small fonts and low contrast) frustrated
            users and increased cognitive load.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Flow Design:</span> Users frequently
            experienced disjointed flows, leading to restarts and premature
            decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Search Functionality:</span> Buggy calendars
            and difficulties finding hotel locations made search tasks
            cumbersome.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Option Comparison:</span> Excessive
            scrolling and information overload prevented users from effectively
            comparing hotels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Adding Extras:</span> Unclear descriptions,
            confusing pricing, and inconsistent options created friction when
            adding extras.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Booking Completion</span>: The lack of
            transparency in the final booking steps created uncertainty for
            users.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="mt-small">Design Implications</h3>
        <p>These findings had a significant impact on the design:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The interface needed to be simplified, with improved readability and reduced clutter.</li>
          <li>The flow had to be redesigned to offer more flexibility and guide users through a seamless booking process.</li>
          <li>The search experience required a more intuitive and reliable calendar and map interface.</li>
          <li>Option comparison needed to be streamlined with better filters and layouts to reduce scrolling.</li>
          <li>Extras had to be presented clearly, with dynamic feedback to avoid confusion.</li>
          <li>Booking completion required enhanced transparency and a clear summary for final confirmation.</li>

          Finally, I used Figma to build a high-fidelity interactive prototype for evaluative testing.
        </p>

        <!-- Sketches Subsection with updated spacing -->
        <h3 class="mt-small">Sketches</h3>
        <p>
          I started with sketches to quickly map out design ideas based on the issues found in the analysis. 
          These sketches helped visualise the booking flow, user
          interface, and layout while allowing me to identify and address
          potential issues early in the process.

        <!-- User Flow Diagram Subsection with full-width image and spacing -->
        <h3>User Flow Diagram</h3>
        <p>Next, I created a user-flow diagram to refine the user's path.  
          This also helped identify problems early on and iterate quickly.</p>

        <!-- Prototyping Section with updated spacing -->
        <h2 class="mt-medium">Prototyping</h2>
        <p>
          After finalising the design with sketches and user flow diagrams, 
          I developed a high-fidelity interactive prototype in Figma for evaluative testing.

        <!-- Streamlined Interface Design -->
        <h3 class="mt-small">Streamlined Interface Design</h3>
        <p>
          The simplified interface was designed to prioritise key booking elements, 
          reducing cognitive load for users. By minimising clutter, 
          the design allowed users to focus on essential tasks, 
          resulting in a more intuitive and efficient booking process.

        <!-- Optimised Flow Design with Progressive Disclosure -->
        <h3 class="mt-small">Optimised Flow Design with Progressive Disclosure</h3>
        <p>
          The booking flow was restructured using progressive disclosure, 
          guiding users step-by-step through the process. Breadcrumb navigation 
          was added to help users track their progress and backtrack easily without confusion.
        </p>

        <!-- Enhanced Search Functionality -->
        <h3 class="mt-small">Enhanced Search Functionality</h3>
        <p>
          The calendar and map were designed using proven, familiar elements to make hotel searches 
          easier and more intuitive. The interactive calendar offers real-time feedback with hover 
          highlights, and the map dynamically updates hotel locations based on user selection—bringing 
          together well-known tools for a smooth and seamless booking experience.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/images/search-functionality.png" alt="Improved search functionality with interactive calendar and map" class="full-width mt-small mb-medium" />

        <!-- Improved Option Comparison -->
        <h3 class="mt-small">Improved Option Comparison</h3>
        <p>
          A horizontal filter bar was introduced to give more space beneath for displaying hotel options in a grid layout. 
          This design allows for more options to be shown across the screen at once, reducing excessive scrolling.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/images/option-comparison.png" alt="Improved option comparison with filter bar and grid layout" class="full-width mt-small mb-medium" />

        <!-- Clearer Addition of Extras -->
        <h3 class="mt-small">Clearer Addition of Extras</h3>
        <p>
          A dedicated extras modal was introduced to offer clear descriptions and pricing, 
          with the booking summary dynamically updating to show the total cost as extras 
          are added or removed.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/images/extras.png" alt="Clear extras modal with dynamic pricing updates" class="full-width mt-small mb-medium" />

        <!-- Improved Booking Completion Transparency -->
        <h3 class="mt-small">Improved Booking Completion Transparency</h3>
        <p>
          A detailed booking summary was added so users could review all their selections—dates, room type, 
          and extras—before confirming their booking. Editable fields allow for last-minute changes without 
          needing to restart the process.
        </p>
