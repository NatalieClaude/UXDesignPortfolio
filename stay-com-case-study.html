          Stay.com is a desktop app developed during my UX Design Professional
          Diploma, aimed at addressing common user experience issues found in
          hotel booking platforms. This project builds on successful design
          patterns while resolving usability challenges, creating a streamlined,
          user-friendly booking process.

            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>
              Many hotel booking websites suffer from poor usability,
              frustrating users with confusing navigation, unclear information,
              and inefficient booking processes. The goal was to create a
              website that prioritises intuitive design, clarity, and
              efficiency, delivering a smoother and more pleasant booking
              experience.

            <h3>The Process</h3>
            <p>
              To identify key issues, I conducted user research through
              competitive benchmarking, surveys, and user testing. The research
              data was synthesised into six key issues through an analysis that
              included affinity mapping and customer journey mapping.
              Low-fidelity sketches and user flow diagrams were then developed
              to explore early design decisions, followed by a high-fidelity
              interactive prototype created in Figma. This prototype was tested
              for effectiveness and several points for further development were
              identified.

          To ensure credible findings, I applied a triangulation method,
          incorporating competitive benchmarking, user surveys, interviews, and
          usability testing. This cross-referenced data helped identify patterns
          and solidify insights, ensuring that the design decisions were based
          on comprehensive research.

            A detailed booking summary was added so users could review all their
            selections—dates, room type, and extras—before confirming their
            booking. Editable fields allow for last-minute changes without
            needing to restart the process.

          I conducted user tests to evaluate the design's effectiveness by
          having users book a hotel room through the prototype.
