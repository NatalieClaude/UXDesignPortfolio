          Stay.com is a desktop app developed during my UX Design Professional
          Diploma, aimed at addressing common user experience issues found in
          hotel booking platforms. This project builds on successful design
          patterns while resolving usability challenges, creating a streamlined,
          user-friendly booking process.

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Many hotel booking websites suffer from poor usability, frustrating
          users with confusing navigation, unclear information, and inefficient
          booking processes. The goal was to create a website that prioritises
          intuitive design, clarity, and efficiency, delivering a smoother and
          more pleasant booking experience.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Process Section -->
      <section id="process" class="case-study-section">
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>
          To identify key issues, I conducted user research through competitive
          benchmarking, surveys, and user testing. These findings were
          synthesised into six primary usability problems using affinity
          mapping, customer journey mapping, and user flow diagrams.
          Low-fidelity sketches were developed, followed by a high-fidelity
          interactive prototype in Figma, which was tested for effectiveness and
          refined based on user feedback.

      </section>

     <!-- Research Section -->
<section id="research" class="case-study-section">
  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>
    To ensure credible findings, I applied a triangulation method, incorporating competitive benchmarking, user surveys, interviews, and usability testing. This cross-referenced data helped identify patterns and solidify insights, ensuring that the design decisions were based on comprehensive research.
  </p>

  <h4>Research Tools</h4>
  <p>
    A combination of methods was used to gather insights, including surveys, user interviews, competitive analysis, and usability testing.
  </p>

      <!-- Analysis Section -->
      <section id="analysis" class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Using tools such as affinity mapping, customer journey maps, and user
          flow diagrams, I synthesised unstructured data into key insights that
          directly influenced design decisions. The analysis uncovered the
          following six key issues:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Interface Design</span>: Busy interfaces
            with poor readability (small fonts and low contrast) frustrated
            users and increased cognitive load.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Flow Design</span>: Users frequently
            experienced disjointed flows, leading to restarts and premature
            decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Search Functionality</span>: Buggy calendars
            and difficulties finding hotel locations made search tasks
            cumbersome.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Option Comparison</span>: Excessive
            scrolling and information overload prevented users from effectively
            comparing hotels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Adding Extras</span>: Unclear descriptions,
            confusing pricing, and inconsistent options created friction when
            adding extras.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Booking Completion</span>: The lack of
            transparency in the final booking steps created uncertainty for
            users.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Design Implications</h3>
        <p>These findings had a significant impact on the design:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The interface needed to be simplified, with improved readability and
            reduced clutter.
          </li>
          <li>
            The flow had to be redesigned to offer more flexibility and guide
            users through a seamless booking process.
          </li>
          <li>
            The search experience required a more intuitive and reliable
            calendar and map interface.
          </li>
          <li>
            Option comparison needed to be streamlined with better filters and
            layouts to reduce scrolling.
          </li>
          <li>
            Extras had to be presented clearly, with dynamic feedback to avoid
            confusion.
          </li>
          <li>
            Booking completion required enhanced transparency and a clear
            summary for final confirmation.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Design Section -->
      <section id="design" class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>
          The design process involved moving from initial sketches to
          prototypes, and finally to implementing solutions that directly
          addressed the findings from the analysis.
        </p>

        <!-- Sketches Subsection -->
        <h3>Sketches</h3>
        <p>
          I started with low-fidelity sketches to quickly iterate on potential
          solutions. These sketches helped visualise the booking flow, user
          interface, and layout while allowing me to identify and address
          potential issues early in the process.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/images/sketches.jpg" alt="Sketches" />

        <h4>Sketch Example (with annotations):</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Arrow pointing to sketch layout</span>:
            "Initial wireframe sketch for the streamlined booking flow."
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Arrow pointing to navigation</span>:
            "Concept for breadcrumb navigation to enhance user orientation."
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Arrow pointing to calendar sketch</span>:
            "Early design for the booking calendar to improve usability."
          </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Prototyping Subsection -->
        <h3>Prototyping</h3>
        <p>
          After the initial sketches, I created a medium-fidelity interactive
          prototype using Figma. This prototype allowed me to refine the booking
          flow, navigation elements, and interaction design, and also helped me
          gather feedback from user testing.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/images/Homepage.png" alt="Figma Prototype" />

<!-- Design Solutions Subsection -->
<h3>Design Solutions</h3>
<p>
  After gathering feedback from user testing and incorporating findings from the analysis, I implemented the final design solutions. These solutions were aimed at improving usability, streamlining the booking process, and resolving the key pain points identified during research.
</p>

<!-- Streamlined Interface Design -->
<h4>Streamlined Interface Design</h4>
<p>
  The interface was simplified to focus on key booking elements, reducing cognitive load. By minimizing clutter, users were able to focus on essential tasks, which helped reduce the cognitive load.

      <!-- Evaluative Testing Section -->
      <section id="testing" class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Evaluative Testing</h2>
        <p>
          I conducted user tests to evaluate the design's effectiveness by
          having users book a hotel room through the prototype. Key findings
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold-text">Interface Design:</span>Generally
            well-received, though text size was occasionally noted as too small.
          </li>
          <li>
