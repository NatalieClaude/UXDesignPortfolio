      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>
        The UX design process involved five key stages: research, analysis,
        design, prototyping, and evaluative testing. Each phase contributed to
        refining and improving the booking experience on Stay.com.

      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>

    <!-- Design Section -->
    <section id="design" class="case-study-section">
      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        The design phase focused on solving the identified problems by creating
        wireframes and mockups. The layout was simplified, and key actions were
        made more intuitive.
