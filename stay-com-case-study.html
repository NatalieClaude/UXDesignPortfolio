              <p class="spaced-paragraph">
                Many hotel booking websites suffer from poor usability,
                frustrating users with confusing navigation, unclear
                information, and inefficient booking processes.
              </p>

              <p>
                The goal was to create a website that prioritises intuitive
                design, clarity, and efficiency, delivering a smoother and more
                pleasant booking experience.

                To identify key issues, I conducted user research through
                competitive benchmarking, surveys, and user testing. The
                research data was synthesized into six key issues through an
                analysis that included affinity mapping and customer journey
                mapping.
              </p>

              <p>
                Low-fidelity sketches and user flow diagrams were then developed
                to explore early design decisions, followed by a high-fidelity
                interactive prototype created in Figma. This prototype was
                tested for effectiveness, and several points for further
                development were identified.

          A horizontal filter bar was introduced to give more space beneath for
          displaying hotel options in a grid layout. This design allows for more
          options to be shown across the screen at once, reducing excessive
          scrolling.

          A dedicated extras modal was introduced to offer clear descriptions

          total cost as extras are added or removed.
