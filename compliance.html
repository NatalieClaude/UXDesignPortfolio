      <h1>Educational Compliance Application</h1>

      <p>
        Since September 2024, I have been engaged in the redesign of an
        Educational Compliance and Auditing App, designed to assist educational
        institutions in efficiently managing regulatory compliance and auditing
        processes. My role has involved improving the appâ€™s usability,
        simplifying complex workflows, and enhancing accessibility to support a
        diverse range of users within educational environments. While specific
        project details remain confidential under a Non-Disclosure Agreement
        (NDA), my contributions have focused on applying user-centered design
        principles to make compliance tasks more intuitive and seamless, helping
        institutions meet regulatory standards with confidence and ease.
