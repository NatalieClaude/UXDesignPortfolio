              <h3>The Problem</h3>
              <p class="spaced-paragraph">
                The Cork Public Museum, like many museums, faces challenges in
                sustaining visitor engagement both during and after their visit,
                particularly among younger audiences. The post-visit phase
                presents significant potential for enhancing engagement, yet
                current tools are generally static and lack the interactivity
                needed to foster an ongoing connection with visitors.
              </p>

              <p>
                This gap offers a valuable opportunity to strengthen engagement
                by focusing on the post-visit stage and introducing an
                interactive tool that keeps visitors connected after they leave.
                Addressing this need could not only encourage return visits but
                also establish a model for similar institutions.

              <p class="spaced-paragraph">
                The goal was to create an engaging, interactive post-visit app
                that bridges the on-site and post-visit experience. Designed as
                a fun, game-like tool, the app aims to enhance on-site
                engagement, sustain interest after the visit, and encourage
                visitors to return.

              <h3>The Process</h3>
              <p class="spaced-paragraph">
                To develop this concept, I conducted user research, including
                curator interviews, on-site observations, and a comprehensive
                literature review of prior work. The insights were synthesised
                and prioritised using affinity mapping and MoSCoW prioritisation
                to define key design requirements.
              </p>

              <p>
                Early design concepts were shaped with user flow diagrams and
                low-fidelity wireframes, leading to an interactive prototype
                built with Unity and Vuforia. This prototype underwent
                evaluative testing, revealing several areas for further
                development.

          <p>
            The literature review highlighted a clear gap: the need for a
            dynamic, interactive post-visit tool for museums. The post-visit
            stage holds great potential to engage visitors and existing tools
            mainly focus on either interactive on-site experiences or static
            post-visit resources, revealing a distinct opportunity for a more
            engaging, interactive post-visit tool.

              <h3>Approach and Methods</h3>
              <p>
                To ensure credible findings, I applied triangulation — combining
                curator interviews, on-site observations, and academic research
                to identify patterns and solidify insights. This triangulated
                approach grounded the design decisions in comprehensive research
                and cross-referenced data.

              To create an engaging, interactive post-visit experience for
              primary school children, Escape The Museum was designed to meet
              the key requirements identified above. Each design decision was

              Escape The Museum, centred on the War of Independence exhibition,
              unfolds in two stages: it begins with the museum visit, where
              children receive physical clues to locate artefacts, sparking
              curiosity and engagement with the exhibition. At home, these
              tangible items unlock features in a mobile AR escape room game,
              blending the museum experience with the post-visit through an
              interactive mix of physical and digital elements.
