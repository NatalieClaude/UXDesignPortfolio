              <h3>The Problem</h3>
              <p class="spaced-paragraph">
              Many museum post-visit experiences and tools lack interactivity, failing to keep children engaged and connected to the
              artefacts after leaving the site. This limits the museum's ability to foster continued engagement and encourage return
              visits.
              </p>

              <p>
              The goal was to create a highly engaging, interactive, post-visit app that seamlessly connects the on-site and post-visit experience,
              using engaging and intuitive design to enhance learning, foster engagement, and encourage return visits.

              <p class="spaced-paragraph">
            User research, including curator interviews, on-site observations, and academic studies, was synthesised and prioritised
            using affinity mapping and MoSCoW, defining key design areas.
              </p>

              <p>
                Low-fidelity sketches and user flow diagrams shaped early decisions, leading to a prototype built with Unity and
                Vuforia, which was tested and refined for further development.

          <h3>Research: Approach and Methods</h3>
          <p>
            To ensure credible findings, I used triangulation, combining curator interviews, on-site observations, and academic
            research. This cross-referenced data identified patterns and solidified insights, ensuring design decisions were
            grounded in thorough research.

          <h3>Research Gap</h3>
          <p>Previous research shows the significant potential of the post-visit phase to boost visitor engagement, but current tools
          focus on on-site tech or static designs, revealing a gap and a clear need for a dynamic, interactive post-visit tool for
          museums.</p>

                <p>
                  Research showed that reinforcing a visitor's memory of their museum visit strengthens emotional connections, encourages return visits,
                  promotes word-of-mouth, and deepens ongoing engagement with the museum.

                <p>
                  The tool must be cost-effective for both the museum and visitors, as the museum is a small, local institution supported
                  by local authority funding and offers free access to the public.

              to make hotel searches easier and more intuitive. The interactive
              calendar offers real-time feedback with hover highlights, and the
              map dynamically updates hotel locations based on user
              selection—bringing together well-known tools for a smooth and
              seamless booking experience.

              A horizontal filter bar was introduced to give more space beneath

              for more options to be shown across the screen at once, reducing
              excessive scrolling.
