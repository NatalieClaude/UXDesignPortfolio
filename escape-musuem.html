              <h3>The Problem</h3>
              <p class="spaced-paragraph">
                The Cork Public Museum, like many museums, faces challenges in
                sustaining visitor engagement both during and after their visit,
                particularly among younger audiences. The post-visit phase
                presents significant potential for enhancing engagement, yet
                current tools are generally static and lack the interactivity
                needed to foster an ongoing connection with visitors.
              </p>

              <p>
                This gap offers a valuable opportunity to strengthen engagement
                by focusing on the post-visit experience and introducing an
                interactive tool that keeps visitors connected long after they
                leave. Addressing this need could not only encourage return
                visits but also establish a model for similar institutions.

                The goal was to create an engaging, interactive post-visit app
                that bridges the on-site and post-visit experience. Designed as
                a fun, game-like tool, the app aims to enhance on-site
                engagement, sustain interest after the visit, and encourage
                visitors to return.

              <h3>The Process</h3>
              <p class="spaced-paragraph">
                To develop this concept, I conducted user research, including
                curator interviews, on-site observations, and a comprehensive
                literature review of prior work. The insights were synthesised
                and prioritised using affinity mapping and MoSCoW prioritisation
                to define key design requirements.
              </p>

              <p>
                Early design concepts were shaped with low-fidelity sketches and
                user flow diagrams, leading to an interactive prototype built
                with Unity and Vuforia. This prototype underwent evaluative
                testing, revealing several areas for further development.

          <h3>Research Gap</h3>
          <p>
            A literature review highlighted a clear gap: the need for a dynamic,
            interactive post-visit tool in museums. While the post-visit phase
            has untapped potential to boost visitor engagement, existing tools
            mainly focus on either interactive on-site experiences or static
            post-visit resources. This reveals a distinct opportunity for a more
            engaging, interactive solution specifically aimed at the post-visit
            experience.

              <h3>Approach and Methods</h3>
              <p>
                To ensure credible findings, I applied triangulation—combining
                curator interviews, on-site observations, and academic research
                to identify patterns and solidify insights. This triangulated
                approach grounded the design decisions in comprehensive research
                and cross-referenced data.

              To create an engaging, interactive post-visit experience for
              primary school children, Escape The Museum was designed to meet
              the key requirements identified above. Each design decision was
              aligned with the goal of bridging the on-site and post-visit
              experiences to enhance engagement, sustain interest, and encourage
              return visits.

            <p>
              Escape The Museum spans two stages: it begins during the museum
              visit, where children receive tangible clues to locate specific
              artefacts, sparking curiosity and interaction with the exhibits.
              At home, these items unlock features in a mobile AR escape room
              game, blending physical and digital interactions to reinforce
              memories, deepen connections with museum content, and keep young
              visitors engaged long after their visit.

                the tangible clues collected on-site would guide children’s

              Visitors begin by collecting clues in the form of four tangibles
              and instructions. This on-site task encourages exploration by
              guiding them to specific artefacts, enhancing interaction with the
              exhibits and creating memorable learning moments.
            </p>

            <p>
              Post-visit, they open the app and scan AR codes on the tangibles
              to unlock digital game features, bridging on-site and digital
              experiences in a dynamic, engaging way that sustains their
              interest even after leaving the museum.

          <h3>Tangibles</h3>

          <p class="spaced-paragraph">
            Each tangible is a low-fidelity, hand-made item resembling a
            specific museum artefact, designed to bridge the on-site and digital
            experiences. Grounded in academic research on tangible interaction
            as a proven way to engage younger children, these items act as clues
            on-site and serve as AR keys in the post-visit app, extending the
            museum experience through hands-on interaction.
          </p>
          <p class="spaced-paragraph">
            Created as static, low-distraction items, the tangibles allow
            children to focus on exhibits without detracting from the
            experience. Their resemblance to the artefacts reinforces memories
            of the visit, supporting learning through digital interaction at
            home. Cost-effective and simple to produce, they offer the museum an
            affordable way to create a meaningful connection with visitors.
          </p>
          <p class="spaced-paragraph">
            Together, these tangibles make the museum visit more interactive and
            memorable while remaining budget-friendly for the museum.
