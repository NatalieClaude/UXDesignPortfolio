              <h3>The Problem</h3>
              <p class="spaced-paragraph">
                The Cork Public Museum, like many museums, faces challenges in
                sustaining visitor engagement both during and after their visit,
                particularly among younger audiences. The post-visit phase
                presents significant potential for enhancing engagement, yet
                current tools are generally static and lack the interactivity
                needed to foster an ongoing connection with visitors.
              </p>

              <p>
                This gap offers a valuable opportunity to strengthen engagement
                by focusing on the post-visit experience and introducing an
                interactive tool that keeps visitors connected long after they
                leave. Addressing this need could not only encourage return
                visits but also establish a model for similar institutions.
              </p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>The Goal</h3>
          <p class="spaced-paragraph">
            The goal was to create an engaging, interactive post-visit app that
            bridges the on-site and post-visit experience. Designed as a fun,
            game-like tool, the app aims to enhance on-site engagement, sustain
            interest after the visit, and encourage visitors to return.

              <h3>The Process</h3>
              <p class="spaced-paragraph">
                To develop this concept, I conducted user research, including
                curator interviews, on-site observations, and a comprehensive
                literature review of prior work. The insights were synthesised
                and prioritised using affinity mapping and MoSCoW prioritisation
                to define key design requirements.
              </p>

              <p>
                Early design concepts were shaped with low-fidelity sketches and
                user flow diagrams, leading to an interactive prototype built
                with Unity and Vuforia. This prototype underwent evaluative
                testing, revealing several areas for further development.

          <h3>Research Gap</h3>
          <p>
            A literature review highlighted a clear gap: the need for a dynamic,
            interactive post-visit tool in museums. While the post-visit phase
            has untapped potential to boost visitor engagement, existing tools
            mainly focus on either interactive on-site experiences or static
            post-visit resources. This reveals a distinct opportunity for a more
            engaging, interactive solution specifically aimed at the post-visit
            experience.
          </p>
          <h3>Approach and Methods</h3>
          <p>
            To ensure credible findings, I applied triangulation—combining
            curator interviews, on-site observations, and academic research to
            identify patterns and solidify insights. This triangulated approach
            grounded the design decisions in comprehensive research and
            cross-referenced data.

                Recognising that the visitor journey spans both on-site and

                move from the on-site experience to the post-visit app.

              <p class="spaced-paragraph">
                The escape room experience begins on-site, where visitors
                collect clues in the form of four tangible items, along with
                instructions to locate and learn about specific museum
                artefacts.

              Additionally, these tokens are cost-effective; they are small,

              The app further sustains engagement with an escape-room-style

              accessible directly on visitors' own mobile devices, ensuring

              A cartoon-style 2D room with hidden clues, interactive furniture,
              and a camera for AR mode provides a vibrant, intuitive layout that
              keeps children engaged.

            <p class="spaced-paragraph">
              The camera enables users to scan tangible AR codes to access
              artefact-related quiz questions, linking physical items to digital
