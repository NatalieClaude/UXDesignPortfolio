      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        I graduated from the
        MSc Interactive Media at University
        College Cork, Ireland, in March 2023, where I discovered my passion for
       Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Thesis Project</h2>
      <p>
        My thesis project focused on increasing engagement among children at the
        Cork Public Museum. I designed and developed an interactive, tangible,
        mixed reality escape room tailored to complement a specific museum
        exhibition. The game incorporated
        Tangibles
        to engage children and link the on-site museum experience with an
        interactive post-visit app.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Further Education</h2>
      <p>
        To further my skills and knowledge in
        HCI, I completed a
        Professional Diploma in UX Design from
        the UX Design Institute, Ireland, in October 2023. My final project
        focused on improving and redesigning the online hotel booking
        experience.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Professional Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Since August 2024, I have been working with CyberSmarties Ltd., an
        educational platform dedicated to promoting safe social media use among
        children. In this role, I have led a redesign of their platform to
        improve user-friendliness, visual appeal, and engagement for young
        users. Additionally, I have been contributing to a compliance app
        project aimed at streamlining the compliance process for independent
        learning schools in the United States, ensuring an intuitive and
        accessible user experience that meets industry standards. With these
        projects now coming to an end and nearly two years of combined
        experience from professional roles, academic projects, and case studies
        in UX design, I am excited to transition into an Associate UX Designer
        position to apply my skills and take on new challenges.
